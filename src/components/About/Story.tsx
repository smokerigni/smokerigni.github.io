      <p>
        My name is Ignác Török. Having eight years' experience
        in structuring, I have acquired proficient web developing skills, both at developing and at implementing
        interactive web services. My actual focus is the frontend with Reactjs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of my professional career, I designed minor web works. As a result, a couple of
        relatively
        simple, custom-built webpages were established as well as a few mini-games in Unity. This period was an
        impressive learning phase, for these early successes indeed had a great impact on me and encouraged me
        to
        continuously engage in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I had obtained a web programming degree, I first cooperated in the development of an online
        journal
        engine. Then I started working in a high school as system monitoring administrator.
      </p>
      <h3>Back to school</h3>
      <p>
        There were 136 clients and 3 servers in the high school – I was in charge of maintaining all the
        machines
        and network devices, both software and hardware. I worked really hard and often went to the office on
        weekends, too. However, I have gained a handful of experience and a deeper apprehension in understanding
        larger systems.
        <br/>
        For programming fits rather to my interests than repairing, I left the job after almost a year.
      </p>
      <h3>Hello world</h3>
      <p>
        Later on, I was employed by a company in Budaörs, which dealt with web development and system
        maintenance.
        Actually, the complete repertoire included web development, system administrator services, (e-)commerce,
        and
        IT consulting. I worked there as a midlevel PHP developer between 2015 and 2017. This environment also
        provided me specific experiences in terms of corporate governance, operating customer services and
        frameworks. Previously, I had been operating all by myself, but then I learnt a lot about teamwork and
        what
        it is like being the part of a seven-member team.

      <h3>MaxWhere, the future's software</h3>
      <p>
        I first met the MaxWhere team in 2016, when they were looking for a user interface developer. They
        shared
        their interesting ideas with me, and – since I liked their software – I decided to be the part of this
        project in January 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        This software proved its potential serving as a rich location of future’s education and collaboration.
        The
        original idea was an innovative presentation tool, which now is suitable for a much more diverse usage.
        Worked closely with the UX team, my task was to develop the user interface of the software.

        Open to work!
